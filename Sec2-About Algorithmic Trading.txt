Prevelance of Automated Trading

~10% of trades only made by human, rest automated 
Most likely means that automated trading out preforms manual trading
Numbers might be misleading since it looks at volume and not individual 
  since they hold positions longer than automated systems or traders
  A lot of automated systems buy and sell several times within a day, some
    within same minutes, multiple times across many symbols.
